    "One of the things that makes thomas the chatbot smart is that he has a high iq.",
    "Now you may think that his iq makes him smart but that's not the case.",
    "This misconception is the reason why thomas has not been accepted into MENSA, despite meeting requirements.",
    "MENSA is an iq society (???) where only high iq people can go.",
    "Thomas the chatbot is not even a person so this is all pointless :)."
